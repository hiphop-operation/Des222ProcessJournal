# First journal Entry 

**Week one**

Week one is the beginning of my brainstorming sessions as well as starting to learn how to use the micro-bit to its fullest potential.

immediately i am thinking of creating a website or app that responds to the weather and alerts the user of certain conditions.

I started by working through the modules for knowledge and inspiration.

i found the MeatQueen project to be particularly interesting especially the interaction itself. the connection between user and artwork creates an exciting and immersive experience and is something im very interested in recreating.

Playing around with the Responsive roulette page found in the modules was a creative way to get me thinking about the possibilites with this project.
