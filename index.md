# First journal Entry 

**Week one**

Week one is the beginning of my brainstorming sessions as well as starting to learn how to use the micro-bit to its fullest potential.

immediately i am thinking of creating a website or app that responds to the weather and alerts the user of certain conditions. I want to do this because i think its something everyone can benefit from and is easily accessibly through mobile phones and computers.

I started by working through the modules for knowledge and inspiration.

**Meat Queen**
<br>
i found the MeatQueen project to be particularly interesting especially the interaction itself. the connection between user and artwork creates an exciting and immersive experience and is something im very interested in exploring.

**Responsive Roulette**
<br>
Playing around with the Responsive roulette page found in the modules was a creative way to get me thinking about the possibilites with this project. As well as thinking about the indivuidal components that will come together in my project.

**Micro-Bit MakeCode**
<br>
By experimenting with the micro-bit by following some of the introductory tutorials found on the micro-bit makecode editor. I was able to creating an acceloromator that would light up the LEDs if it was tilted to the right.

I see alot of potential with this design already. Such as a simple pedometor that can be attached to the ankle and counts each shake it feels. or to be placed inside a basketball to also count the amount of bounces.

Though once i created this i noticed that when i sat it down and left it on it would feel the vibrations though the floor and start to flicker when it sensed movement. This video shows how it flashing while i walk in place.

I have found this particularly useful while im at my desk with headphones on i can tell when someone is opening the door or walking through the house. (it even works for the big dog) It stops my roommates from sneaking up behind me and scaring me.

I just found this intersting and kind of enjoy the interaction and how seemless it is. Im not sure if i can work further with this but i though it was worth mentioning.

# Week 2

In week 2 i began exploring more options for my device such as wearable devices and data responsive art. The data responsive art made me think back to the albedo of clouds experiment that we read about earlier in the course where two photographers tried to capture an image of the same cloud at the same time from different rooftops. 

**albedo of clouds**
<br>
This made me think i could create something that is data driven and relates to cloud albedo levels in specific areas.

maybe i could try recreate the 1950s experiment of trying to photograph the same cloud from different perspectives at the same time and create a platform for posting and collaborating.

**wearable techonology**
<br>
Looking at the devices shared in the modules such as the celestial sensing jumpsuit and learning about the light up back-pack straps that respond to sound to warn deaf people of potential hazards made me think of potential wearable devices i could create.

I could create something that it worn on the wrist in a game of basketball using the micro bit that can use the acceloromotor to retrieve the angles of someones arm so they can compare how their movement might change during practise. 

A device for pets to be worn around the collar that when the device reaches a certain decible level a sound will play to discourage them. This could useful to prevent loud animals becoming disruptive. 

# Week 3

Working through the modules i added the device orientation and media capture apis to the weather api web page that we created earlier in the course.

I figured it would be a good idea to have all the information in one location for easier access in the future and could be something i keep coming back to in the future to work off of.
