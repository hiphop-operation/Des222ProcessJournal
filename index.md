# First journal Entry 

**Week one**

Week one is the beginning of my brainstorming sessions as well as starting to learn how to use the micro-bit to its fullest potential.

immediately i am thinking of creating a website or app that responds to the weather and alerts the user of certain conditions. I want to do this because i think its something everyone can benefit from and is easily accessibly through mobile phones and computers.

I started by working through the modules for knowledge and inspiration.

# Meat Queen
i found the MeatQueen project to be particularly interesting especially the interaction itself. the connection between user and artwork creates an exciting and immersive experience and is something im very interested in exploring.

# Responsive Roulette
Playing around with the Responsive roulette page found in the modules was a creative way to get me thinking about the possibilites with this project. As well as thinking about the indivuidal components that will come together in my project.

# Micro-Bit MakeCode
By experimenting with the micro-bit by following some of the introductory tutorials found on the micro-bit makecode editor. I was able to creating an acceloromator that would light up the LEDs if it was tilted to the right.

I see alot of potential with this design already. Such as a simple pedometor that can be attached to the ankle and counts each shake it feels. or to be placed inside a basketball to also count the amount of bounces.

Though once i created this i noticed that when i sat it down and left it on it would feel the vibrations though the floor and start to flicker when it sensed movement. This video shows how it flashing while i walk in place.

I have found this particularly useful while im at my desk with headphones on i can tell when someone is opening the door or walking through the house. (it even works for the big dog) It stops my roommates from sneaking up behind me and scaring me.

I just found this intersting and kind of enjoy the interaction and how seemless it is. Im not sure if i can work further with this but i though it was worth mentioning.
